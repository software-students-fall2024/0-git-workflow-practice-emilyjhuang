**[How software engineering is revolutionizing healthcare solutions](https://www.htworld.co.uk/insight/opinion/how-software-engineering-is-revolutionizing-healthcare-solutions/)**

As someone interested in using software engineering and data analytic skills to help find solutions in the healthcare field I found the above article particularly intereseting. The article talks about how software engineering is revolutionizing healthcare by improving efficiency, access, and patient outcomes. The author points out several key advancements made including the Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for streamlined data management, telemedicine for remote consultations, wearable devices for continuous monitoring, and AI for diagnostics and treatment plans. The article also touches upon the future of robotics and data analytics in enhancing surgeries and predicting health trends. These innovations have the power to make the healthcare field more personalized and accessible, leading to better patient care and (hopefully) reduced costs. Reading the article made me happy and excited to see what the world of data and medicine working together has to offer and the potential changes that can come with the advancements of these two.

I completely agree with this sentiment. Writing clean code is often seen as secondary to delivering 
features quickly, but in the long run, itâ€™s one of the most crucial aspects of software 
development. Clean code not only saves time during future development but also reduces bugs and 
improves collaboration. It's easier for team members to understand, modify, and build upon code 
that is well-structured and readable. Adopting clean code principles fosters better teamwork and 
long-term project sustainability, benefiting everyone involved in.
